Sure thing! Let's get you set up with Rancher on Kubernetes using Helm. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

### Prerequisites

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: Ensure you have a running Kubernetes cluster.
2. **kubectl**: Make sure you have `kubectl` installed and configured to access your cluster.
3. **Helm**: Install Helm if you haven't already.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Add the Rancher Helm Repository

First, you need to add the Rancher Helm chart repository to your Helm installation:

```sh
helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest
helm repo update
```

#### Step 2: Create a Namespace for Rancher

It's a good practice to create a separate namespace for Rancher:

```sh
kubectl create namespace cattle-system
```

#### Step 3: Install Cert-Manager

Rancher requires cert-manager to manage certificates. Install it using Helm:

```sh
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update

kubectl create namespace cert-manager

helm upgrade -i cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true
```

Wait for cert-manager to be up and running:

```sh
kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager
```

#### Step 4: Install Rancher

Now, you can install Rancher. Here, we'll use a self-signed certificate for simplicity:

```sh
kubectl create namespace cattle-system

helm upgrade -i rancher rancher-stable/rancher --namespace cattle-system --set bootstrapPassword=rancherSecurePassword --set hostname=[any-name].[public-ip].sslip.io

# Wait for the deployment and rollout

# Verify the status of the Rancher Manager
watch kubectl get pods --namespace cattle-system

```

Replace `<your-rancher-hostname>` with the DNS name you want to use for accessing Rancher, and `<your-admin-password>` with a secure password for the admin user.

If you have a custom certificate, you can use the `--set tls=external` flag and provide the certificate details.

#### Step 5: Verify the Installation

Check the status of the Rancher pods to ensure they are running:

```sh
kubectl -n cattle-system get deploy rancher
```

Wait until all the Rancher pods are up and running.

#### Step 6: Access Rancher

Rancher should now be accessible at the hostname you provided. If you're using a self-signed certificate, you may need to add an exception in your browser to access the Rancher UI.

#### Step 7: Configure Rancher

Open your browser and go to `https://<your-rancher-hostname>`. You should see the Rancher login screen. Use the admin password you set during the installation to log in.

### Additional Configuration

- **Setting up Ingress**: You can set up an ingress controller like NGINX to manage external access to Rancher.
- **Setting up Let's Encrypt**: If you prefer Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates, you can configure Rancher to use Let's Encrypt for automatic certificate management.
