Design Thinking and Event Storming are both methodologies used in the development of products and services, but they serve different purposes and are used at different stages of the design and development process. Here's a detailed comparison between the two:

### Design Thinking

**Definition:**
Design Thinking is a user-centric approach to problem-solving and innovation that emphasizes understanding the needs of the users, challenging assumptions, and redefining problems in an attempt to identify alternative strategies and solutions. It is iterative and focuses on a deep understanding of the user experience.

**Phases:**
1. **Empathize:** Understand the needs, thoughts, emotions, and motivations of the users through research and observation.
2. **Define:** Clearly articulate the problem you want to solve based on insights gathered during the Empathize phase.
3. **Ideate:** Brainstorm a wide range of creative solutions to the defined problem.
4. **Prototype:** Build tangible representations (prototypes) of one or more of your ideas to explore potential solutions.
5. **Test:** Share prototypes with users and gather feedback to refine the solutions.

**When to Use:**
- When you are starting a new project and need to understand the needs and problems of your users.
- When you are looking for innovative solutions to complex problems.
- When you need to foster a culture of creativity and collaboration.
- When the problem is ambiguous and requires exploration to define clearly.

### Event Storming

**Definition:**
Event Storming is a workshop-based method used for modeling complex business processes. It is often associated with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and is used to explore and understand the flow of events in a system. The focus is on identifying domain events, commands, aggregates, policies, and external systems.

**Phases:**
1. **Big Picture Event Storming:** Identify high-level events that occur within the domain. This phase helps in understanding the overall system and its interactions.
2. **Process Level Event Storming:** Dive deeper into specific processes by detailing the sequence of events, commands, and interactions.
3. **Design Level Event Storming:** Focus on the technical implementation details, such as aggregates, policies, and bounded contexts.

**When to Use:**
- When you need to understand and map out the business processes within a system.
- When working on complex domains where different parts of the system need to be understood and aligned.
- When designing or refactoring the architecture of a software system.
- When you need to involve domain experts and gather their insights into the process.

### Key Differences and When to Use Each

| Aspect                  | Design Thinking                                           | Event Storming                                            |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**             | Solve user-centric problems creatively and innovatively   | Understand and model complex business processes            |
| **Focus**               | User experience and empathy                               | Domain events and business logic                           |
| **Output**              | Innovative solutions, prototypes, and user feedback       | Detailed process models, event flows, and domain understanding |
| **Participants**        | Diverse team including designers, developers, and users   | Domain experts, developers, architects                     |
| **Stages of Use**       | Early stages of product development                       | Mid to late stages, particularly during system design or refactoring |
| **Methodology**         | Iterative, creative, and exploratory                      | Structured, collaborative, and detail-oriented             |

### Practical Usage Scenario

**Design Thinking Scenario:**
- A company wants to develop a new mobile app to help users manage their personal finances. The problem is not well-defined, and there are many potential user needs to explore. The team conducts Design Thinking workshops to empathize with users, define the core problem, brainstorm creative solutions, prototype a few concepts, and test them with users to gather feedback and iterate on the designs.

**Event Storming Scenario:**
- A company is looking to refactor its existing e-commerce platform. The system has grown complex over time, and there are many intertwined business processes. The team conducts an Event Storming workshop to map out the high-level events, dig into the detailed processes, and identify the key domain events, commands, aggregates, and policies. This helps them understand the system better and design a more modular and maintainable architecture.

In summary, use Design Thinking when you need to explore and innovate solutions with a focus on user experience, and use Event Storming when you need to deeply understand and model the business processes and domain logic within a system.
